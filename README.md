# Accuracy-Assessment-and-Error-Analysis-of-Labelling-in-Point-Cloud-Data-A-Comparative-Study

This project focused on evaluating the accuracy of individual tree segmentation within LiDAR point cloud data. Utilizing tools like LiDAR360 and CloudCompare, the project employed confusion matrix and kappa analysis to quantify the segmentation accuracy. Additionally, machine learning algorithms were implemented in MATLABâ€™s Classification Learner to automate the classification of large point cloud datasets, enhancing the efficiency, scalability, and precision of the analysis.
The methods developed in this project have diverse real-world applications. In forestry management, they enable precise tree inventory, biomass estimation, and sustainable forest practices.
